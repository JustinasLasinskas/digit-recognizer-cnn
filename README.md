# Number Recognizer with CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to understand single digit numbers. The CNN is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and can quite accurately classify images of digits.

# Data

The data was downloaded from Kaggle: `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data`  
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset.  
The data is split into train and test datasets/dataframes (not actual images).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustinasLasinskas/number-recognizer-cnn.git
   ```
